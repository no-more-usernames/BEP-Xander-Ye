The code for my bachelor end project.

Python version 3.10 or higher is required to run the code due to switch statements.

No external libraries other than numpy are required

Each file contains a different iteration of the simulation and genetic algorithm. 

V9, V10 and V11 all feature a complete simulation, but with minor differences as to their purposes.

Hyperparameter tuning performed in V9 can take some hours to complete.
